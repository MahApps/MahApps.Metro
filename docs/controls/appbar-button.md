# AppBarButton 

> Due to issues with this control, `AppBarButton` is due to be removed at some point in the future

Inspired by Windows Phone 7's app bar buttons which are a circle button with text underneath.

Use the `AppBarButton` control to use this type of button.  

    <Controls:AppBarButton
       VerticalAlignment="Top"
       MetroImageSource="{StaticResource appbar_barcode}"
       Foreground="{DynamicResource BlackBrush}"
       Content="scan" />
