# FlatButton

This sort of button can be found when you're making a call on Windows Phone - all of the controls (hang up, keypad, etc) are 'flat buttons'.

Flat button lives in   
`<ResourceDictionary Source="pack://application:,,,/MahApps.Metro;component/Styles/FlatButton.xaml" />`

You'll need to import that as well to use it.
