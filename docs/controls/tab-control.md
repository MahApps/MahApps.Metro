###Tabs

There are three included tab styles - Animated Tab Control, Single Row Animated Tab Control and the default Tab Control. The default Tab Control style is included in `Controls.xaml`, but the other two require specific referencing (make sure to do this *after* a reference to `Controls.xaml`)

**Default look**
