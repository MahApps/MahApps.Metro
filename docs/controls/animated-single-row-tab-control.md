# AnimatedSingleRowTabControl

``<ResourceDictionary Source="pack://application:,,,/MahApps.Metro;component/Styles/Controls.AnimatedSingleRowTabControl.xaml" />``
`AnimatedSingleRowTabControl` functions exactly the same as the `AnimatedTabControl` except the tabs will only appear on a single line rather than wrapping. Instead of wrapping, arrows (left/right) are presented.
