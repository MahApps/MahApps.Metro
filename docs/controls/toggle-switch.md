title: ToggleButton - MahApps.Metro
---

The `ToggleSwitch` control originally appeared in Windows Phone 7, but has made its way into Windows 8. The MahApps.Metro version of this control uses the Windows Phone 7 code (ported), but the Windows 8 visuals.

The function is very similar to that of a checkbox, but easier to differentiate and easier to use with touch interfaces. Basically though, it can be thought of as a pretty `CheckBox`

`<Controls:ToggleSwitch Header="WiFi rest state" />`

You can bind to/set `IsChecked` to switch between the two states.  You can change the *on* and *off* labels by setting `<Controls:ToggleSwitch OnLabel="Yes" OffLabel="No" />`
