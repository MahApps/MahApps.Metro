### Some Three Letter Acronyms We Use

**[WIP]** - Work In Progress - this is a tag we include on any pull request that is not ready for consumption. We do this because it's always A Good Thing to start a pull request early so that we can get feedback on it early.

**[RFC]** - Request for Comment - this is a tag we use on any pull request to indicate when we're not sure about something. Perhaps it's an idea for something, perhaps it's a hard issue to nail down. The code might be useless, but this is our way to ask "does this make sense?"
