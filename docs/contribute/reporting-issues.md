So something doesn't work quite right? Read on to help ensure you find the right way to get it seen by the right people.

### How Do I Raise An Issue?

You need a GitHub account to sign up and report an issue. Just about every site out there on the internet requires you to do this so it's not exactly an outrageous request.

Once you've done that, browse to our [Issue List](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/issues) and click **New Issue**.

The bare minimum for an issue is:

 - What version of MahApps.Metro are you using?
 - What version of Windows are you running?
 - What is the behaviour you are seeing?
 - What is the expected behaviour?
 - Any additional details about the code to help illustrate the issue

### Things That Make Our Lives Easier

The more information you can provide us, the quicker we can identify the behaviour and work towards a resolution.

**The quickest way is to provide a demo project which illustrates the issue (a GitHub repository is preferred for ease of consumption).**

As this is a UI library, examples like screenshots or short videos can help contributors to see the issue first-hand. This is particularly helpful when scenarios are hard to recreate.

### Why GitHub?

All of our issues are tracked on GitHub. 

Questions occassionally come up on StackOverflow, but we always try and bring the discussion back to GitHub. 

  - **StackOverflow questions need to be focused** - the format does not lend itself to things that are subjective or UI-related.
  - **StackOverflow is just awful for discussions** - quite often contributors need to diagnose the issue before an answer can be provided. This is made hard by the various design decisions that StackOverflow has made to adhere to a Q&A format.

So we prefer GitHub for tracking issues and bugfixes, as the discussion is free-flowing and more flexible - and it's much easier to associate changes and bugfixes with issues.
