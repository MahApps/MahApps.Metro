## Completely rewritten `BorderlessWindowBehavior`

The `BorlderLessWindowBehavior` has been completely rewritten, to fix a number of issues that have accumulated over time.

For a complete list of fixes, see PR #1156

## Auto-closing flyouts

Flyouts now have an option to be automatically closed when the user clicks outside of the flyout.
We renamed the property `IsPinnable` (that had no use) to `IsPinned` for this. 
`IsPinned` is `true` by default and, if set to false, enables the auto-closing feature.

## RangeSlider

The `RangeSlider` control has been completely rewritten because it was unusably broken before.

See PR #1055 for more info.

## Titlebar enhancements
- The titlebar now supports vector icons
- Added `LeftWindowCommands`
  This means that the normal `WindowCommands` property is now obsolete and is called `RightWindowCommands`
- The minimize/maximize/close button can now be styled

## Others
- Added properties to change the font size of a tile #864 #1013
- Added support for `ToggleButton`s in the window commands #954
