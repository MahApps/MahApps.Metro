# Features

## Auto-closing flyouts

Flyouts now have an option to be automatically closed when the user clicks outside of the flyout.
We renamed the property `IsPinnable` (that had no use) to `IsPinned` for this. 
`IsPinned` is `true` by default and, if set to false, enables the auto-closing feature.

# Fixes

- Fixed the external dialog not being cleaned up propely and crahsing the next dialog #994 #996
