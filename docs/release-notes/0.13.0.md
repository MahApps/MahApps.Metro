## Completely rewritten `BorderlessWindowBehavior`

The `BorlderLessWindowBehavior` has been completely rewritten, to fix a number of issues that have accumulated over time.

For a complete list of fixes, see PR #1156

## Auto-closing flyouts

Flyouts now have an option to be automatically closed when the user clicks outside of the flyout.
We renamed the property `IsPinnable` (that had no use) to `IsPinned` for this. 
`IsPinned` is `true` by default and, if set to false, enables the auto-closing feature.

## RangeSlider

The `RangeSlider` control has been completely rewritten because it was unusably broken before.

See PR #1055 for more info.
