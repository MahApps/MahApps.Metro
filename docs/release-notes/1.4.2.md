- [#2799](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/pull/2799) DateTimePicker SelectedDate issue (thx @xxMUROxx)
    + Fix issue where `SelectedDate` is set to the `DisplayDate` if the `SelectedDate` is `DateTime.MinValue`. This issue appears when binding to a property of DateTime and the date is `DateTime.MinValue`.
- Z-Order was wrong if `MetroWindow` is ignoring the Taskbar and maximized. This fix and the main Taskbar z-Order issue only happens with Windows 10 anniversary update 1607. Hopefully fixed in the future. [#2780](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/issues/2780)
- Use internal GetPhysicalCursorPos instead GetCursorPos (tested with remote desktop and different DPI) [#2748](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/issues/2748)
