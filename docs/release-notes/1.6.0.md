## Breaking Change

MahApps will no longer be strong-named beginning with this version. [#3029](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/issues/3029)

Why?

Strong-named assemblies are only useful in some rare scenarios. If you need strong-named assembly then you can compile the source by yourself ore use the [Strong Namer](https://github.com/dsplaisted/strongnamer) from Daniel Plaisted [@dsplaisted](https://github.com/dsplaisted).

- [XAML Behaviors UWP Managed 1.1.0](https://www.pedrolamas.com/2016/02/23/xaml-behaviors-uwp-managed-1-1-0/)
