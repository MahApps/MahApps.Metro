- Replacing `WindowChrome` and related things with reference to `ControlzEx` [#3021](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/pull/3021)

## Breaking Change

MahApps will no longer be strong-named beginning with this version. [#3029](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/issues/3029)

Why?

Strong-named assemblies are only useful in some rare scenarios. If you need strong-named assembly then you can compile the source by yourself ore use the [Strong Namer](https://github.com/dsplaisted/strongnamer) from Daniel Plaisted @dsplaisted or [Strong-Name Signer](https://github.com/brutaldev/StrongNameSigner) from Werner van Deventer @brutaldev.

More informations about the reason of this decision can be found here:
