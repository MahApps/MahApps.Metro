# Notes

This is the first stable release of MahApps.Metro.

We removed everything marked as obsolete and made some API changes, but from now on MahApps.Metro follows Semantic Versioning, at least API wise. Please note that minor visual changes can still occur if there's a need for them.

A migration guide for the breaking changes is available here: https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/blob/master/docs/v1.0-Migration-Guide.md

# Features

- Added a StatusBar and StatusBarItem style #1558
- Added the `TitleVisibility` and `CloseButtonVisibility` properties to the flyouts to control the visibility of the header.
- Added the `ButtonHelper.PreserveTextCase` attached property to control the automatic upper and lower casing of certain buttons. #1622
- If an .ico file contains multiple icon sizes, `MetroWindow` now automatically selects the optimal icon size. #1242 #1628

# Changes

- The `IsOpenChangedEvent` of the `Flyout` control is now a routed event
- The animation of the `Flyout` control matches the Windows 8 flyout behavior more closely #1460
