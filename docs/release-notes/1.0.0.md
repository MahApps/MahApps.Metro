# Notes

This is the first stable release of MahApps.Metro.

We removed everything marked as obsolete and made some API changes, but from now on MahApps.Metro follows Semantic Versioning, at least API wise. Please note that minor visual changes can still occur if there's a need for them.

A migration guide for the breaking changes is available here: https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/blob/master/docs/v1.0-Migration-Guide.md
