- Don't focus flyout on close [#2671](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/pull/2671) (@ButchersBoy) This hack was introduced with [#1805](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/pull/1805) which was noticed by manual testing.
- Don't focus the `FlyoutsControl`
- Fix another `TopMost` issue: If the window is top most and you switch to another window the top most will be gone.

- Icon scaling [#2667](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/pull/2667) (@thoemmi)
	+ New property `IconScalingMode` to MetroWindow. It's forwarded to `MultiFrameImage.MultiFrameImageMode` to set the icon scaling.

		It takes the smallest frame which from the icon which has equal or larger size as the window's icon template. The frame is scaled down it's larger.

- Changes for `DateTimePicker` and `TimePicker` [#2710](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/pull/2710)
	+ Change `DateTimePicker.SelectedDate` to `BindsTwoWayByDefault`. The reason is that we do not have to use Mode=TwoWay explicit, and DatePicker.SelectedDate has BindsTwoWayByDefault too.
	+ [Fix] Issue where Binding issues on DateTimePicker/TimePicker are shown on the output window
	+ [Fix] Issue where Hour 0 is not shown when using 24h clock
	+ Fix issue where clearing text does not immediately set value to `null` but `00:00:00` and `0001.01.01 00.00.00` respectively
