# Notes

This release, again, contains some breaking changes. 
We try to break things now rather than later, when we release version 1.0 (which is hopefully soon).

A quick overview:

- `ProgressIndicator` is now removed, as it wasn't working as expected. 
   Use `MetroProgressBar` with `IsIndeterminate = True` instead, which should give a much smoother experience.
- Like `ProgressIndicator`, `MetroImage` has been removed because it was broken. 
  A better alternative is to use a simple `Rectangle`, as described [here](http://mahapps.com/MahApps.Metro/guides/icons-and-resources.html)

# Features

## Dialog system

The dialog system has been overhauled for better extensibility.

The `SimpleDialog` class now allows to create a custom dialog.

`ProgressDialog` is a dialog that displays progress (duh!) inspired by Github for Windows.

For reference, see PR [#785](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/pull/785)

## Modal Flyouts

Just like modal dialogs, Flyouts can now be made modal by setting the `IsModal = true`.
