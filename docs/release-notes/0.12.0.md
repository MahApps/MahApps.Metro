# Features

## Dialog system

The dialog system has been overhauled for better extensibility.

The `SimpleDialog` class now allows to create a custom dialog.

`ProgressDialog` is a dialog that displays progress (duh!) inspired by Github for Windows.
`InputDialog` works like the `MessageDialog` but allows the user to input text.
