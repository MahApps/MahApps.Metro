MahApps.Metro is a project that [Paul Jenkins](http://vikingco.de/) started back in 2011 as a simple way to bring a Metro-style user interface into your WPF application. 
Since then it's evolved and taken contributions (at last count there were 300+ forks) from various people in the community.

This has been a project for the community, by the community - none of us are paid to do this, and we do it out of our love of code.

So if you love this project and want it to get better, get involved!
