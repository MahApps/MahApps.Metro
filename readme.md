* [Pull requests](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests)

You need [Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition](<https://www.visualstudio.com/>) to build the solution (comes with [#2330](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/pull/2330)), so we can use the new C# 6 features. You can use the [dev-vc2013](<https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/tree/dev-vc2013>) branch if you still have the Visual Studio 2013, but no new feature or fix will be added in this branch by meâ„¢.

## Styles

`CheckBox` and `RadioButton` styles adapted from styles created by [Brian Lagunas of Infragistics](http://brianlagunas.com/free-metro-light-and-dark-themes-for-wpf-and-silverlight-microsoft-controls/).

## A short How To

Or, how to create a simple `MahApps.Metro` Application and a Window...

```XML
<Application x:Class="WpfApplication.App"
             xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
             StartupUri="MainWindow.xaml">
  <Application.Resources>
    <ResourceDictionary>
      <ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
        <ResourceDictionary Source="pack://application:,,,/MahApps.Metro;component/Styles/Controls.xaml" />
        <ResourceDictionary Source="pack://application:,,,/MahApps.Metro;component/Styles/Fonts.xaml" />
        <ResourceDictionary Source="pack://application:,,,/MahApps.Metro;component/Styles/Colors.xaml" />
        <ResourceDictionary Source="pack://application:,,,/MahApps.Metro;component/Styles/Accents/Blue.xaml" />
        <ResourceDictionary Source="pack://application:,,,/MahApps.Metro;component/Styles/Accents/BaseLight.xaml" />
      </ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
    </ResourceDictionary>
  </Application.Resources>
</Application>
```

```XML
<controls:MetroWindow x:Class="WpfApplication.MainWindow"
                      xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
                      xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
                      xmlns:controls="http://metro.mahapps.com/winfx/xaml/controls"
                      Title="MainWindow"
                      Height="600"
                      Width="800">
  <Grid>

    <!-- your content -->

  </Grid>
</controls:MetroWindow>
```

```csharp
namespace WpfApplication
{
  public partial class MainWindow : MetroWindow
  {
    public MainWindow()
    {
      InitializeComponent();
    }
  }
}
```
