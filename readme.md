###Bug reporting
If you wish to report a bug, you need to work with, not against me.

If there are visual issues, provide a *screenshot*. If there are animation issues, you may need to provide a screencast.

If you're having issues with resources, you *need* to provide the XAML on how you're importing them and *where* you're importing them.
Failure to do so will result in issues just being closed.
