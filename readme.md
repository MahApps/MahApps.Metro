### A short How To

Or, how to create a simple `MahApps.Metro` Application and a Window...

```XML
<Application x:Class="WpfApplication.App"
             xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
             StartupUri="MainWindow.xaml">
  <Application.Resources>
    <ResourceDictionary>
      <ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
        <ResourceDictionary Source="pack://application:,,,/MahApps.Metro;component/Styles/Controls.xaml" />
        <ResourceDictionary Source="pack://application:,,,/MahApps.Metro;component/Styles/Fonts.xaml" />
        <ResourceDictionary Source="pack://application:,,,/MahApps.Metro;component/Styles/Colors.xaml" />
        <ResourceDictionary Source="pack://application:,,,/MahApps.Metro;component/Styles/Accents/Blue.xaml" />
        <ResourceDictionary Source="pack://application:,,,/MahApps.Metro;component/Styles/Accents/BaseLight.xaml" />
      </ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
    </ResourceDictionary>
  </Application.Resources>
</Application>
```

```XML
<controls:MetroWindow x:Class="WpfApplication.MainWindow"
                      xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
                      xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
                      xmlns:controls="http://metro.mahapps.com/winfx/xaml/controls"
                      Title="MainWindow"
                      Height="600"
                      Width="800">
  <Grid>
    <!-- now your content -->
  
  </Grid>
</controls:MetroWindow>
```

```csharp
namespace WpfApplication
{
  public partial class MainWindow : MetroWindow
  {
    public MainWindow()
    {
      InitializeComponent();
    }
  }
}
```

### Visual Studio Templates

Yes we did it! We have now 4 simple templates to start with the awesome MahApps.Metro library.

* WPF MahApps.Metro Application (.NET4)
* WPF MahApps.Metro Application (.NET45)
* Visual Basic WPF MahApps.Metro Application (.NET45)
* Window MahApps.Metro (WPF)

Download this [Templates.zip](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro/raw/master/Visual%20Studio%20Templates/Templates.zip) (templates are created with VS 2013) and extract it to your user template folder:

```
c:\Users\<USER>\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\
```

Now you can choose the templates at the `New Project` dialog.
