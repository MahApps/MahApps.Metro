**To Reproduce**

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Environment(please complete the following information):**
 - MahApps.Metro version [e.g. v1.6.4]
 - OS: [e.g. Win10 1803]
 - Visual Studio [e.g. 2017 15.7.1]
 - .NET Framework [e.g. 4.7.1]

**Repo**
If it's possible follow these guidelines for a good sample and I will most likely look at the issue sooner:

  - Post a full GitHub repository. Not a zip file, half baked snippet etc. If GitHub is new to you consider it a great learning opportunity and chance to get involved.
  - The repository should have just ONE step max for me to get running, and that is "Restore NuGet Packages". If there are any other missing dependencies, or uncompiling features I will most likely move on to another issue.
  - I'm not trying to be awkward. I'm just busy and I'm helping a lot of people, not just you, so help me out and I will help you out.

**Additional context**
