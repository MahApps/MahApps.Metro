# PLEASE READ BEFORE POSTING AN ISSUE

This is a place for issues for MahApps itself. Questions are better asked in the [Gitter](https://gitter.im/MahApps/MahApps.Metro) room or at [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mahapps.metro).

### Seriously consider creating and linking to a test repo which takes absolutely minimal setup to illustrate how reproduce the problem.

My time is limited and .Zip files, code snippets and partial examples are often a time sink. GitHub also provides great communication and code review tools which can be utilised.

## HOW TO POST A GOOD SAMPLE.

Follow these guidelines and I will most likely look at the issue sooner:

* Post a full GitHub repository. Not a zip file, half baked snippet etc. If GitHub is new to you consider it a great learning opportunity and chance to get involved.
* The repository should have just ONE step max for me to get running, and that is "Restore NuGet Packages". If there are any other missing dependencies, or uncompiling features I will most likely move on to another issue.
* I'm not trying to be awkward. I'm just busy and I'm helping a lot of people, not just you, so help me out and I will help you out.
